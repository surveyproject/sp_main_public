5. SECURITY

If using Windows 2003 - IIS6 or higher

6. DATABASE CONNECTION
- go to the rootdirectory of the SP site
- open the web.config file in notepad or any other texteditor
- find the appropriate database connection string in the web.config file: there are connectionstrings for different databases (e.g. Development, Test, Production):

  <!-- selection of database connection options & settings-->
  <connectionStrings>
    <add name="SurveyProjectDevConnectionString" connectionString="Data Source=.\yoursqlserver;Initial Catalog=YourSpDevDatabase;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=yourusername;Password=yourpassword" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
    <add name="SurveyProjectTestConnectionString" connectionString="Data Source=.\yoursqlserver;Initial Catalog=YourSpTestDatabase;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=yourusername;Password=yourpassword" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
    <add name="SurveyProjectProdConnectionString" connectionString="Data Source=.\yoursqlserver;Initial Catalog=YourSpProdDatabase;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=yourusername;Password=yourpassword" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
  </connectionStrings>

- Next set the default dbconnection to use on the SP site:

  <!-- Survey Project database connection: to select connectionsetting options see connectionStrings-->
  <dataConfiguration defaultDatabase="SurveyProjectProdConnectionString" />


7. SMTP MAILSETTINGS
- open the web.config file in notepad or a texteditor
- check smpt settings. Default is:
		<add key="NSurveySMTPServer" value="127.0.0.1" />
		<add key="NSurveySMTPServerPort" value="25" />
		<add key="NSurveySMTPServerAuthUserName" value="" />
		<add key="NSurveySMTPServerAuthPassword" value="" />

       		<add key="NSurveySMTPServerEnableSsl" value="false"/>  


8. CULTURE/UICULTURE
- The language setting of your webbrowser will determine the XML languagefiles used to translate webpage texts. 
- This effect is caused by one of the settings in the web.config file: culture/ uiculture. 
- If set to "auto" (default) Survey™ Project will pick up culture/ language of preferred browser settings. 
- To explicitely pick a culture/ language, replace auto with "en-US" or "nl-NL" for example. 


9. START WEBAPPLICATION
- open your webbrowser
- browse to http://[nameofyourwebserver]/[NameOfSurveySite] or your hosting URL
- the application will start running 


10. DEFAULT ADMINISTRATOR LOGIN
