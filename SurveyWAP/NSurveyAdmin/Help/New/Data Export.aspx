to any external third party reporting tool like Excel or SSPS.<br />
<br />
* <i>Data Selection</i> -  Option to export all answers or only
  specific answers of a survey.<br />
<br />
* <i>Export in</i> - is the format in which to export respondents
  answers. CSV is the most widely accepted format, especially with older
  tools. However Xml can be used with the new versions of Excel or
  Access.<br />
<br />

  exported answers columns inside a CSV.<br />

  before replacing it again after having imported the data inside the
  target tool.<br />
