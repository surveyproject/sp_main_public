                <br />

Report filters are used to setup a set of rules based on the
survey's questions and answers. Once a filter is created and
rules are added to it, it can be assigned to a report or a chart. Once a filter as been applied all results
calculation will be done accordingly to the filter that has been set up.<br />
<br />
* <i>Filter Name</i> - is the name of the filter that will contain the rules.<br />
<br />
* <i>Conditional Rule Operator</i> - is the operator that Survey will use to
  evaluate the rules inside the filter. At this time only a single
  conditional operator (AND, OR) can be applied to a group of rules
  inside a filter.<hr style="color:#e2e2e2;" /> <br /><h3>More Information</h3>
