                <br />

The file manager is created to manage all the files that have been uploaded by
the respondent using the Extended%20-%20File%20Upload.html answer type.<br />
<br />
<u>Uploaded Files</u>
                <br /><br />
The list of uploaded files is presented. They can be downloaded locally.
Note: there is an option to see the respondent answers details by clicking on
the &quot;Details&quot; link (Posted By column) on the right of the &quot;Download&quot; link.<br />
<br />
<u>Export All Files To Server's Directory</u><br />
If there is a large number of files, downloading each file one by one can
quickly become a very cumbersome task.<br />
<br />
That's why there is an option to export all files that were uploaded to a directory
on the (web)server. Note &quot;write&quot; rights are necessary on the server
directory to which we will export the files.<br />
<br />
* <i>Create File Group Directories</i><br />
<br />
  o No sub-directory groups will copy all the files inside the same
    directory.<br />
  o Voter Id group will group the files uploaded by the same
    respondent under the same directory.<br />
  o File-GUID sub-directory will group the files uploaded on the same
    answer item inside the same directory.<br />
<br />
* Full Path On Server is the complete path  of the directory on the
  server to which the files are going to be exported.<hr style="color:#e2e2e2;" /> <br /><h3>More Information</h3><br />
