                Once respondents have finished answering the survey on submitting their answers
                the survey can be set to trigger a "completion action" at the end of the survey. <br /><br />
                Available actions:<br />
                <br />
                <b>&quot;Thank you&quot; Message</b><br />
                <br />
                This will show a message (created with the text/html editor) to the respondent once the survey
                is finished and submitted. It could be used to thank the user or possibly provide some information
                about the survey taken. <br />
                <br /><i>Settings</i><br /><br />
                * Edition Language<br />
                This is the language in which the &quot;Thank You&quot; message text is edited and
                in which language it will be shown. A language can be selected, the text changed
                and when the update button is clicked the text will be assigned to the selected
                language.<br />
                <br />
                This feature is only available if the survey's <a href="Multi-Languages Settings.aspx" title="Multi Languages">Multi Languages Settings</a>
                are activated.<br />
                <br />
                * Thanks Message<br />

                <br />
                <br /> <br />
                <b>URL Redirection</b><br />
                <br />
                This action will redirect the user to a specific (web)page or URL once the survey is completed.<br />
                <br />
                * Edition Language<br />
                The language for which the redirection will occur. This is also the language in
                which the &quot;Thank You&quot; message text is edited and in which language it
                will be shown.<br />
                <br />
                This feature is only available if survey's <a href="Multi-Languages Settings.aspx" title="Multi Languages">Multi Languages Settings</a>
                are activated.<br />
                <br />
                * Thanks Message<br />
                This is the message that will be shown to the end user once the survey is completed.
                This message will only show up if no redirection URL is specified. It is mostly
                used in case of multiple languages and a redirection is used for one language but
                not for the others.<br />
                <br />

                http://www.youdomain.com/yourpage.aspx <br />
                                <br />
                <br />
                <b>Results Report</b><br />
                <br />
                This action will redirect the user to the Resultsreport webpage once the survey is completed and submitted. 
                Through the results report the respondent will get an overview of all survey questions, the answers submitted and scores (if set). 
                An option to print the report is shown on the page. The content and layout of the resultsreport 
                is based on and similar to the <a href="New/Voter report.aspx" title="Voter Report">Individual Results Report</a>.

                                <b>Custom Results Report</b><br />
